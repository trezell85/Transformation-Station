      <h2>What are classroom transformations?</h2>
      <p>
        Classrooms transformations are a great way to engage your students and
        to make a engaging learning environment. Transformations can be anything
        that will turn your classroom in a new and exciting learning
        environment. Some teachers have transformations that are as simple as
        giving their students a construction hat and an apron. While others will
        tape plastic table cloths on their windows, and desks. Then have
        inflated dinosaurs propped up all around the room. Classroom
        transformations can be used for one day, a week, or a month. It's
        totally up to the teacher and their lesson plans.

      <h2>Why are classroom transformations so great?</h2>
      <p>
        Keeping your students engaged with fractions and compound sentences can
        be tough. Most students are thinking, "This is so boring". Obviously you
        don't want you kids to be bored. However, you have your standards that
        are sent by the state that you have to teach. This is where Classroom
        Transformations come in. Classroom transformations grab your students
        attention and make learning fun for them. They are so busy enjoying
        cutting a pizza that they don't realize that they are using the
        fractions that you taught them.

      <h2>Where do I start?</h2>
      <p>
        Classroom transformations are super easy! It can be as simple as putting
        table cloths on their desks and giving them a magnifying glass. It can
        also be as extravagant as changing your entire classroom. The biggest
        and most important thing about transformations is spend as less as you
        can. Beg and borrow items whereever you can! Many businesses are willing
        to donate items. You can borrow from other teachers in your building.
        Sometimes you can even use items that are in your own home. There are
        times where you will spend your own money. However, if you buy durable
        items, you can use them again and again. Some things can be used for
        different transformations within one school year. Other times there are
        items that you will just use from year to year.

        For the Grocery Store transformation our class was studying Money. To
        make the grocery store as real life as possible, I asked parents,
        neighbors, and family members to send me their cleaned trash. I used
        testing dividers to separate the different sections. The desks were
        organized to make "aisles" in the classroom. I bought some plastic fruit
        from the Dollar Tree for my Garden transformation and I used it for this
        transformation too. Powerpoints are an essential! I googled pictures of a grocery store and put them into the powerpoint to create a slideshow. I also recorded myself on the powerpoint saying phrases that the kids might hear while walking in a grocery store. During this transformation, my students had a
        shopping list. They chose items off of their list and then they had to
        add up how much they spent. There were also other questions on their
        paper that had them count coins to determine the value.

        The Pizzeria transformation is a favorite amongst many! During this
        transformation, I play Italian Pizzeria music. The students are studying
        are fractions. They are tasked with making a pizza and cutting the
        ingredients into thirds, halves, and fourths. For this transformation I
        provide the students with Lunchable Pizzas. In past years, I have had
        parents to donate these. The room is decorated to look like an actual
        Pizzeria. The table cloths were purchased from Amazon. I used little
        candles and placemats on their desks to make them feel like they were
        really at a restaurant. The large pizzas on the wall were made out of
        butcher paper. This transformation is fun and memorable because they
        students get to eat their fractions after they've completed their work.

        The Football transformation is perfect for the Friday before Super Bowl
        Sunday. During this transformation, there wasn't a particular skill that
        we used. During Math we reviewed many skills with Football themed
        activities. ELA wasn't centered around Football at all. I just used
        football themed slides in my powerpoint. The kids were involved in this
        transformation by wearing their favorite teams jersey or sweatshirts. I
        was dressed as a referee. Many of the decor items were purchased from
        Amazon and Oriental Trading. You'll be surprised at how many different
        thematic items stores will have. The lights that I have in my classroom
        always add a magical touch. I purchased those from Amazon as well. I use
        them with every transformation.

        Aaaaah! Dinosaurs! This transformation was a huge success! Not only did
        we transform our classroom, but we also transformed the hallway as well.
        When the kids came to school that day, we had dinosaur growls playing
        thoughout the hallway. We covered the lights with green butcher paper to
        give a green jungle hue. We also had the theme music from Jurassic Park
        playing. We used white butcher paper to make fossils and used brown
        butcher paper for dino paw prints. All of this definitely grabbed their
        interests and had them wondering what was in store for them once they
        got into the classroom. I decorated my room with donated dinosaur
        inflatables, and ivy vines that I purchased from Amazon. I also
        purchased safari hats, and binoculars for the kids. I played sound
        affects all day long. Hearing dinosaur growls definitely kept the kids
        on their toes all day.

      <p>
        Beach day is one of my favorites. This was a transformation for the very
        last day of school and I defintely went all out. I cooked meatballs, and
        baked cupcakes! This was their special end of the year treat. All of the
        students' desks were moved into the corner of my room so that I could
        have as much space as possible. I covered up the desks with floor to
        ceiling butcher paper rolls. I borrowed the beach chairs, and kiddie
        pool from our PE teacher. The teacher that was in the classroom before
        me left tons of seashells. I used these to decorate different areas in
        the room. I purchased a couple of pails from the dollar tree to hold
        sand in. The sand came from one of our science kits that we didn't use.
        The other decoratoins were from my friend's swimming pool parties that
        she used to have. This is why it's so important to ask any and everyone
        you know for help. If I had bought everything that I used in this
        transformation, I would have spent hundreds of dollars.

        The garden transformation was my very first transformation. It was super
        neat. I was reading a book title "Tops and Bottoms". It was a story
        about a bear and a rabbit growing vegetables. I purchased plastic
        vegetables from the Dollar Tree to use a decorations. The kids went
        "digging" for clues to determine the central message of the story.
        Another teacher on my team let me borrow her flower decor from her room.
        I also borrowed a shovel from my friend's dad. I dressed up as a farmer.
        For this to be my very first transformation, it turned out great! The
        lesson was a success and the kids had fun.
