        My name is Tarneka Ezell and I have been teaching for about 13 years. I attended the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, and received my bachelors degree in Human Ecology Child and Family Services: Pre-K-4. I have taught grades PreK, 4th, and 2nd. I would have to say that I love 2nd grade the most. This is where I have spent most of my teaching career. I have only taught in two districts in Middle Tennessee. I love transforming my classroom. I love to see the excitement in my students' faces when they first walk into the room. Creating transformations takes a lot of work, but it is always a great experience for everyone involved.
